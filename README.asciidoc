Kakoune Language Server Protocol Client
---------------------------------------

Implemented in Rust.

Installation
-----------

Replace `~/.local/bin/` with something on your `$PATH`

----
$ git clone https://github.com/ul/kak-lsp
$ cd kak-lsp
$ cargo build --release
$ ln -s $PWD/target/release/kak-lsp ~/.local/bin/
$ ln $PWD/rc ~/.config/kak/autoload/lsp
----

Usage
-----

`kak-lsp` is able to connect multiple editor sessions to multiple language servers. Therefore `kak-lsp` process should be started separately and having single one running is enough.

The easiest way to enable LSP support for language, i.e. Rust, is to add following to `kakrc`:

----
hook global WinSetOption filetype=rust %{
    lsp-enable
}
----

It will add support for completions, hover and will bind goto definition to `gd`.

Unfortunately, LSP servers commands and supported file extensions are hardcoded at the moment. They are:

|===
| Language | Extensions | Server command
| Rust | .rs | rls
| JavaScript | .js | flow-language-server --stdio
|===

Making server configurable is #1 priority and will be done before extending LSP features support.
